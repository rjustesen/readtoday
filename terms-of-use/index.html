You hereby grant Operator and its designees a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, transferable, sublicenseable license (the “License”) to sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit and prepare derivative works of Your Content in connection with the Site or the conduct of Operator’s business in any formats and through any media channels.
